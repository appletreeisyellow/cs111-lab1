In this lab, we exploited inter (not intra) command tree parallelism.
The dependency between files decides whether commands can run in parallel
or not. Disable parallelism when multiple commands are accessing the file 
and one of them is writing. 

There are three type of dependency:

	1. 	RAW  (Read-After-Write)
		e.g. 	echo b > a.txt
				cat a.txt
			
	2. 	WAW  (Write-After-Write)	
		e.g. 	 echo a > a.txt
				echo b > a.txt

	3.	WAR  (Write-After-Read)
		e.g.  	cat a.txt
				echo b > a.txt  

(We can do parallelism if two commands are reading from the same file.)

Ways to determine Read/Write from/to a file:

	Read from a file:
    - 1st word after <
	- All the arguments in the simple command
	
	Write to a file:
    - 1st word after >
	
We have two lists to keep track of the dependency relationships between files:

	file_list:  Stores the input/output files. Each file has its index number.
				If a file is already stored in the list, no need to store it again. 

    dependency_list: A 2D array that graphs the dependency relationship between commands 
					 and files. The first dimension represents the index of command 
					 trees. The second dimension represents the index of files. We 
					 used 1 to indicate READ, 2 to indicate WRITE, and 0 to indicate 
					 no dependency. 


Limitations: 
	1.	We only consider the word after > is a write type file. 
		This lab does not consider commands, such as "cp" "diff", 
		write to any files.
